## C Binary Trees

### What is a binary tree?
In computer science, a **binary tree** is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. That is, it is a [k-ary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-ary_tree) with k = 2. A recursive definition using set theory is that a binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set containing the root.

### Learning objectives:
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

### Requirements:

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the standard library
* All your header files should be include guarded
